    #Smith JA CDT A-1 '16. 2018 Jan 3. Assistance given to the author,
    #verbal discussion.  After class, CDT Smith and I discussed the best 
    #way to draw a circle in the bullsEye program. He decided to create
    #a function that would draw a circle by first taking a center point's coordinates as input.
    #I agreed and created my own function called drawCircle that took the 
    #center coordinate as input in my own program. West Point, NY.

    #Jones, IB CDT B-1 '17. 2017 Sep 14.  Assistance given to the author,
    #verbal discussion.  CDT Jones and I met and discussed the homework
    #assignment and developed an approach to the programming problem. 
    #We decided to first obtain the upper left corner coordinates of the circle.
    #We each wrote our own solution.  However, my program did not run and CDT Jones
    #looked at my code and helped me find the misspelled variable in line 23.  West Point, NY.

    #Smith JA CDT A-1 '16. 2017 Sept 15. Assistance given to the author,
    #verbal discussion.  CDT Smith and I discussed how to do the homework and helped
    #each other understand the different parts we had to complete.  We each typed our 
    #own version of the assignment but we worked together to get all of it completed.

**NOTE**:  The textbook is considered common knowledge for all material covered in the course.  If you want to place comments to explain where in the text you found material, then those comments are welcome but not required.

    #I looked up the equation for the radius of a circle on page 12.
    #I used the equation for determining the coordinates of a point on the 
    #circumference of a circle based on its center point and radius.

Example of Citing Verbatim Copying from Our Text
-------------------------------------------------
**NOTE**: It is scholarly practice to give credit where credit is due. If you use a program not covered in class in a primarily verbatim manner (which was not done in either example above) and without changing the capabilities of that program, it is good practice to cite as:
